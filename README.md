# StellarisModDropperGOG

small script to unzip Stellaris mods from http://stellaris.smods.ru/ and put them into 
C:\Users\*YOURUSERNAME*\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\mod for the GOG version of the game.
it also changes the path in the .mod file inside the zip to match the GOG version of Stellaris.

simply drop the mod zips onto the .exe/.pyw icon.

download smdGOG.exe in StellarisModDropperGOG/dist/smdGOG.exe

only tested with windows 10. im fairly certain it wont work on win 7 but you can test it anyway.
