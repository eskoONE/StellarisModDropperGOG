# StellarisModDropperGOG
small tool to unzip Stellaris mods for the GOG version of the game and edit the 
.mod file to correct the correct path.

simply drag and drop mod.zips onto the script icon to unzip and copy contents to
the mod folder of the GOG version of Stellaris. if the folder doesnt exist, it 
gets created. double click the script icon to open the mod folder of Stellaris 
in the file explorer instead.

get the smdGOG.py script if you have Python 3.7 installed or want to use the script 
on linux ~or Mac OS~. if not, you can get the exe file for Windows on the [release](https://github.com/eskoONE/StellarisModDropperGOG/releases) page.

**only tested on Windows 10 and linux (manjaro, solus and ubuntu). ~supposed to work on Mac OS~.**

the way i intended this to work wont work on mac os unfortunately. i will eventually make a 
GUI application out of this, but that kinda defeats the purpose of it - being an easy and 
fast solution for ppl playing the GOG version of Stellaris.
