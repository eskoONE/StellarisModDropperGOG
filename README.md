# StellarisModDropperGOG
small tool to unzip Stellaris mods for the GOG version of the game.

simply drag and drop mod.zips onto the script icon to unzip and copy contents to
the mod folder of the GOG version of Stellaris. if the folder doesnt exist,
it gets created. double click the script icon to open the mod folder of Stellaris 
in explorer instead.

get the smdGOG.py script if you have Python 3.7 installed or want to use the script 
on linux or Mac OS. if not, you can get the exe file for windows on the [release](https://github.com/eskoONE/StellarisModDropperGOG/releases) page.

**only tested on windows 10. supposed to work on linux and Mac OS, although not tested.**
